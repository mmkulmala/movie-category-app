# Simple movie categorization app

This is simple movie categorization app done with Quarkus and Kotlin. This now categorizes movies persists, 
but could be used to get movies from IMBD and other sources. While they have the date, this
app could be used to enrich the data.

## Why this solution?

Being interested in Kotlin for couple of years I wanted to create 
something else than a CVBank with it. Quarkus seemed like ideal candidate
after Spring monoliths!

## How to get real data?
